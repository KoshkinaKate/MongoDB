# Description

## Overview

This Node.js application serves as a backend system for managing notes, musics, and musicians. It's built using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## Features

### CRUD Operations

The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for notes, musics, and musicians. Users can perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from the database.

### MongoDB Integration

MongoDB is used as the database to store notes, musics, and musician records. Mongoose is employed to define schemas and models, facilitating interactions with MongoDB collections.

### Express.js

Express.js is employed as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and define API endpoints. Routes are defined for each CRUD operation, allowing clients to interact with the application via RESTful APIs.

### Environment Variables

The application utilizes environment variables managed through the dotenv module. This allows sensitive information such as database credentials to be stored securely and accessed within the application.

### CORS Support

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support is implemented using the cors module, enabling the application to accept requests from other domains.

## File Structure

- **`server.js`**: Entry point of the application. Sets up the Express server, defines middleware, and establishes database connections.

- **`models/`**: Directory containing Mongoose models for notes, musics, and musicians.

- **`controllers/`**: Directory containing controller functions for handling CRUD operations on notes, musics, and musicians.

- **`config/`**: Directory containing configuration files, such as database connection settings.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Set up a `.env` file with necessary environment variables (see `.env.example` for reference).
4. Start the application using `npm start`
5. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3002`, and you can interact with it using the defined API endpoints.
